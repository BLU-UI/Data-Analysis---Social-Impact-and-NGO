# Organization Complexity Analysis

# Uncertainty Analysis
This Uncertainty Anlysis method takes project Cost & Time as input data point.  First it applies triangle distribution & normal distribution to existing 10 data points. Next step, it uses Monte Carlos method, running 1000 times by sampling random variables each time. From this way, we can see how uncertainty impact existing data using a form of topograph.
